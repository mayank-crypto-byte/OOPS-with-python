args and kwargs can solve a whole lot of problems while passing data into the function.


```python 
class example:
    def __init__(self,*args,**kwargs):
        self.name = args[0]
        self.age = args[1]
        self.gender = args[2]

  

    def say(self):
        print("Hello my name is",self.name,"and my age is",self.age,"and my gender is",self.gender)

  

e = example("Mayan",20,"Male")
e.say()
```

this is a very good usage of args. This will help to make the function along the way of thinking.

now, in some case we might also use kwargs to pass specific variables which might not get accepted by the function so to resolve that we use kwargs.

```python
