A class in an Object oriented programming is a template for creating something. 
For example:

consider a candle mold, it has its own properties like dimension but the candles prepared from it are all not the same. They can have different colors. hence we can say that the mold is the ```class``` and candles are the ```object```.

here is an example how to create a class and an object.

```python 
class Example:           #this is a class 
	pass 

obj1 = Example()     #this is the object created from it 
```
